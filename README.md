Online shop based on ReactJS and React friendly libraries.

I used few React libraries:
-React-router-dom, 
-React-Spring, 
-React-styled-components

And scss reprocessor for website layout.


List of main elements to do in App:

-Hight priority:
    -Repair fetching system
    -Repair buying from recommended
    -Connect buying with quantity
    -Make bestsellers category
    -Make latelywatched category
    -Finish bucket, add quantity to items
    -Make modals with details of items

-Low priority:
    -Make page transitions with spring
    -Add animations for elemennts
    -Make pages for items




Things to add in future:
-Reconstruct app to use Redux, maybe Reactcontext
-Make database with MongoDB and GraphQL
-Consider usage of strong type languages-> typescript
